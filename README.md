  Roboflow 3.0 offers different sizes:
  - Fast - Smallest/lightest (available to all)
  - Accurate - Medium size
  - Medium - Larger (paid only)
  - Large - Larger (paid only)
  - Extra Large - Largest (paid only)

  Typical object detection model sizes:
  - Small models: ~20-50MB
  - Medium models: ~100-200MB
  - Large models: ~300-500MB

  For mobile apps, you'd want the Fast version for performance,
  but the exact MB size isn't documented.

  Alternative lightweight approaches:
  - Train a custom TensorFlow Lite model (~5-20MB)
  - Use edge detection + contour filtering (~no model needed)
  - YOLOv8 nano models (~6MB)
